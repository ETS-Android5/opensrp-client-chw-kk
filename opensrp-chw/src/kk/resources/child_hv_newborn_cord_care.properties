child_hv_newborn_cord_care.step1.child_cord_care.text=Your baby's umbilical cord stump dries out and eventually falls off - usually within one to two weeks \
  after birth. In the meantime, treat the area gently:\n\nKeep the stump dry. Expose the stump to air to help dry out the base. Keep the front of your baby's \
  diaper folded down to avoid covering the stump.\n\nDO NOT apply any substance to the cord. It may be dangerous to your baby to apply any substances to his or \
  her cord. Stick with sponge baths. While there's no harm in getting the stump wet, sponge baths might make it easier to keep the stump dry.\n\nLet the stump \
  fall off on its own.Resist the temptation to pull off the stump yourself
